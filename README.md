## Current Projects
At the moment I am working on the code for a few microcontroller that is used throughout our factory to automate some of the manual processes. I am also working on integrating all our machines with the cloud so we can view their statusses in a live dashboard.

## Currently Learning
I am learning C++ properly for the first time because of the degree I am busy with, though I have dabbled with it previously.

## Interests 
My main interests are automation and low-level/baremetal programming. I love being really close to the hardware and I like solving problems and making people's lives easier.
